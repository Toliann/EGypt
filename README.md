# Information
This mod adds a new moon, 10 EGypt to the terminal. 

This moon is balanced as an intermediate moon akin to March or Offense, though tuned slightly higher. 
The moon costs 60 credits to route to, has a slightly larger than average dungeon size, monster total spawn range, and total scrap count range. 
The moon currently uses the Mansion interior dungeon, with a low chance of using the Factory dungeon.
The moon exterior does not spawn giants or trees.
Desert worms, and spiders are much more likely to spawn on this moon. Lethal Company uses weighted spawns, so increased weight does not meant garaunteed chances.

For custom dungeon interiors, the keyword is "Egypt".

# Traversal
The minimum three letter requirement to route to 10 EGypt is "egy".
